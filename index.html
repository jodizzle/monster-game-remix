			A creature originally created in 1879 for purposes of war, you were all but forgotten by society, locked into a period of extended gestation as a measure of mercy by your creator. Now, on the dawn of both a new era and your 21st birthday, a fault in your programming has set you free! -- only for you to soon discover the more terrible faults of modern humanity. In a violent, apocalyptic, shattered and alien reality, it is up to you to demonstrate that your elongated birth-process has not only improved your strength and speed, but also the muscle the 20th century needs most right now: Your Heart.

			The army is out to capture you! They try to frame you as a monster by firing live human beings from the skies! They can't kill you, but you can kill them! Prove yourself the most human by putting them out of their misery with super-CPR! Save the world!
